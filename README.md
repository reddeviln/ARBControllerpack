# ARBControllerpack
Collection of useful Euroscope plugin functions for the Arabian vACC (VATSIM)

This plugin has a built-in timer, does stand assignments, routechecking and provides specific tag items. The configuration is based on different csv files. For an example setup take a look at the OMAE sector file located here: http://files.aero-nav.com/OMAE.
Please respect the license and credit if you use the plugin.

Feel free to open an issue here on github if you have a feature request or bug report.
